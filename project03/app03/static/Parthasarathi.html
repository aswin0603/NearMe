        The Parthasarathi Swami Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord
        Krishna, located in the Triplicane neighborhood of Chennai, Tamil Nadu,
        India. It is one of the oldest temples in the city and holds great
        religious significance for devotees of Lord Krishna. The temple is
        believed to have been built in the 8th century CE and has undergone
        several renovations over the centuries. The temple's architecture is
        typical of South Indian Dravidian style, featuring intricate carvings and
        sculptures. The main deity, Lord Parthasarathi (a form of Lord Krishna),
        is depicted playing the flute, symbolizing divine love and joy. The
        temple attracts a large number of devotees and tourists, especially
        during festivals like Janmashtami, which celebrates the birth of Lord
        Krishna.
