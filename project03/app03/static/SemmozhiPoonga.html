        Located at the bustling junction of Cathedral Road and Anna Salai on the
        former site of the Drive-in Woodlands Hotel, Semmozhi Poonga (Classical
        Language Park) stands as Chennai's premier botanical garden. Opened on
        November 24, 2010, by then-Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, this 20-acre
        sanctuary was developed for ₹80 million through a collaboration between
        the Horticulture and Agricultural Engineering departments. The garden is
        a vibrant center of biodiversity, housing over 500 plant species
        alongside 80 heritage trees—some over a century old—that were preserved
        during the park's construction. Visitors can explore a diverse
        collection of exotic flora, rare plant species, and specialized sections
        dedicated to medicinal and aromatic herbs, making it a vital green lung
        for the city.
